## Introduction

GrowMore CookMore ("we", "our", or "the app") is a gardening and cooking application. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

**We respect your privacy.** GrowMore CookMore is designed to keep your data on your device. We do not collect, store, or sell your personal information to third parties.

---

## Lawful Basis for Processing

Under UK GDPR, we process data based on the following lawful bases:

- **Consent** - For location data (you choose whether to grant location permission)
- **Legitimate Interest** - For app functionality and improving user experience

---

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored On Your Device Only

The following data is stored **locally on your device** and is **never transmitted** to us or any third party:

- **Journal entries** - Your garden notes, photos, and updates
- **Photos** - Images you add to journal entries
- **Shopping lists** - Items you add to your shopping list
- **Expense records** - Your garden expense tracking data
- **Freezer inventory** - Items you track in the freezer feature
- **App preferences** - Your settings and region selection
- **Analytics data** - Usage statistics displayed within the app only

This data remains entirely under your control. We have no access to it whatsoever.

### Information Shared With Third Parties

**Location Data (Optional - With Your Consent)**

If you grant location permission, we use your approximate location to:
- Display current weather conditions
- Provide frost date alerts relevant to your area

**What is transmitted:** Your device's coordinates (latitude and longitude) are sent to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data.

**What is NOT stored:** We do not store your location history. The coordinates are used only for the immediate weather request.

**International Transfer:** OpenWeatherMap servers may be located outside the UK/EU. By granting location permission, you consent to this transfer. OpenWeatherMap provides adequate safeguards for data protection.

You can deny location permission and the app will still function fully, though weather features will show default values. You can change this permission at any time in your device Settings.

## Payment Processing

All payments for subscriptions or in-app purchases are processed solely by **Apple (App Store)**. 

We do not receive or store any payment information, such as:
- Card numbers
- Billing addresses
- Transaction identifiers
- Bank details

Your payment information is handled entirely by Apple in accordance with their privacy policy. We only receive confirmation of whether you have an active subscription.

### OpenWeatherMap

- **Purpose:** Provides weather information for your location

- **Data NOT shared:** Name, email, device ID, or any other personal information
- **Their privacy policy:** https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy

### Recipe Content

Our recipes are sourced from Spoonacular and are bundled within the app. **No live connection to Spoonacular is made** when you use the app - all recipe data is stored locally within the app itself.

### Third-Party SDKs and Analytics

We do **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking SDKs. No crash logs or usage data are transmitted externally.

---

## Data Retention

- **On-device data:** Retained until you delete it or uninstall the app
- **Location data:** Not retained - used only for immediate weather requests
- **Server-side data:** We store no data on any servers

---

## Data Security

All your personal data (journal entries, photos, expenses, shopping lists) is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms. 

Since we don't collect or store your data on external servers, there is no risk of a data breach from our systems.

If you use iCloud backup on your device, your app data may be included in your personal iCloud backup, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.
