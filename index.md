# Privacy Policy for GrowMore CookMore

**Last Updated: November 2025**

## Introduction

GrowMore CookMore ("we", "our", or "the app") is developed by Tony C Smith. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our gardening and cooking app.

**We respect your privacy.** GrowMore CookMore is designed to keep your data on your device. We do not collect, store, or sell your personal information to third parties.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored On Your Device Only

The following data is stored **locally on your device** and is never transmitted to us or any third party:

- **Journal entries** - Your garden notes, photos, and updates
- **Photos** - Images you add to journal entries
- **Shopping lists** - Items you add to your shopping list
- **Expense records** - Your garden expense tracking data
- **Freezer inventory** - Items you track in the freezer feature
- **App preferences** - Your settings and region selection
- **Analytics data** - Usage statistics displayed within the app

This data remains entirely under your control and can be deleted at any time by removing entries within the app or by uninstalling the app.

### Information Shared With Third Parties

**Location Data (Optional)**

If you grant location permission, we use your approximate location to:
- Display current weather conditions
- Provide frost date alerts relevant to your area

Your location is sent to **OpenWeatherMap** (https://openweathermap.org) to retrieve weather data. We do not store your location history. OpenWeatherMap's privacy policy can be found at: https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy

You can deny location permission and the app will still function, though weather features will show default values.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect, store, or have access to:

- Your name or contact information
- Your email address
- Your photos (stored only on your device)
- Your journal entries (stored only on your device)
- Your financial or expense data (stored only on your device)
- Any analytics or usage data (displayed locally only)
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes

## Third-Party Services

### OpenWeatherMap

We use OpenWeatherMap to provide weather information. When you use weather features, your device's location coordinates are sent to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve current conditions. No other personal information is shared.

### Recipe Content

Our recipes are sourced from Spoonacular and are bundled within the app. No live connection to Spoonacular is made when you use the app - all recipe data is stored locally within the app itself.

## Data Storage and Security

All your personal data (journal entries, photos, expenses, shopping lists) is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage. We do not have access to this data, and it is not backed up to any external servers controlled by us.

If you use iCloud backup on your device, your app data may be included in your personal iCloud backup, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.

## Children's Privacy

GrowMore CookMore does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require account creation or collection of personal details.

## Your Rights and Choices

**Deleting Your Data**

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:
- Delete individual journal entries, expenses, or shopping items within the app
- Uninstall the app to remove all app data from your device

**Location Permission**

You can enable or disable location access at any time in your device's Settings > Privacy > Location Services > GrowMore CookMore.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
